<p class='middle_text'>
Giving Profiles is a simple way to collect all your charitable donations in a single place. Use it to keep track of your giving, share your favorite charities with friends, and discover great new organizations to support.  

We are a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale who specialize in motivating people to do more good.  We're not venture capitalists, or serial-startup-ists, and we're not here to make a buck.  We're here to put our research into practice, and see if we can help you make the biggest difference you can.

<h3> And what about my data?  </h3>
<p> We will never share your giving data with anyone. Period.</p>
